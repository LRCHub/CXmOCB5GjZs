Catch my breath and
hold it for me
I'm wasting my time,
trying to make up my mind
I'm sitting here as
the chandelier is whispering
in my ear
Saying, can I get a cigarette?
No you'll never be mine
Can you come around tonight?
And sing me a lullaby
Just take my heart and break it
Can you come around tonight?
I might be the enemy
But nothing quite hits like you
No
Take this pen and write for me
Oh write me a song and
I'll try to forget it
Oh I'm standing there,
as the man upstairs
Comes crashing through
the ceiling
Saying where's my fucking
cigarette?
With fire in his eyes
Can you come around tonight
And sing me a lullaby
Just take my heart and break it
When you come around tonight?
I might be the enemy
But nothing quite hits like you
But as all my patience
Starts to dry
And my feet leave skids
across the sand
Then I'll know that you've won
And I’ll run
Back to where I came from
