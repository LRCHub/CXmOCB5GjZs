Woah, lord forgive me!
Aaaauughh

Finna tear your spleen out for my chandelier
We gon' make you hollowed out like a grizzly bear
You had better kneel down, say the lord's prayer
'Cause you know the Haunted Mound skin you like a deer
For my-For my-For my chandelier, for my chandelier
We gon' pull your spleen out for my chandelier
For my chandelier, for my chandelier
For my chandelier, my chandelier, my chandelier

Vertebrae, a ribcage hang from the ceiling
Sawmill in the redwoods, dissonant screaming
Crooked Man, a crooked hand, claws in the shadows
Laid out like a bear rug on the piano
Candelabra, petrified, crucified
Jacob Marley, I got chains on me
Sematary, Ghost Mountain, we some gargoyles
Hang you like a deer on my chandelier

Finna tear your spleen out for my chandelier
We gon' make you hollowed out like a grizzly bear
You had better kneel down, say the lord's prayer
'Cause you know the Haunted Mound skin you like a deer
For my-For my-For my chandelier, for my chandelier
We gon' pull your spleen out for my chandelier
For my chandelier, for my chandelier
For my chandelier, my chandelier, my chandelier

Ohhh lord
God damn, I love this shit
Haunted Mound t-shirt and Affliction
On ward to glory in the mountains
Cut you like a tree, no Neosporin
You gon' be my chandelier for my mansion
I feel like Woody in the trash can
Me and Ghost cooling in the ossuary
We don't fucking like you, haaa

Finna tear your spleen out for my chandelier
We gon' make you hollowed out like a grizzly bear
You had better kneel down, say the lord's prayer
'Cause you know the Haunted Mound skin you like a deer
For my-For my-For my chandelier, for my chandelier
We gon' pull your spleen out for my chandelier
For my chandelier, for my chandelier
For my chandelier, my chandelier, my chandelier
